Following a tutorial by adafruit I was able to test the sensor and get feedback through the embedded LED in my arduino.Sensing angle: 45 degrees (120 degree spread with cap)Sensitivity: Different from other PIR sensors, this model features a SENS pin (pin 1) which allows you to control sensitiviy of the sensing by manipulating voltage applied through that pin. At 0 volts (ground) the sensor is most sensitive and at 3.3 volts (maximum) the sensor is least sensitive to movement. Using resistors and a given chart from the datasheet one can configure to various levels of sensitivity.Timing: This PIR also features a dedicated pin for manipulating the length of time that the output pin sends HIGH for. At ground this pin sends a minimum of 2 seconds output and at full 3.3 volts this pin can send output for up to one hour! Timing can also be configured in detailmaking use of resistors and a given chart.Distance:The product description on Adafruit’s webpage states that the sensor can read up to 5 meters away but the data sheet refuses to give specificparameters for distance stating that it’s sensing range is “affected by its own SNR, imaging distanceof Fresnel lens, temperature of the moving body, environment temperature and humidity,and electromagnetic interference, etc.” Additionally it states that when the sensor is configured to higher sensitivity (or when the SENSpin voltage is lower) the distance it can read becomes longer.Strengths: The highly configural nature of this sensor gives it a ton of potential for practical and fun applications alike. Specifically the ability to manipulate sensitivity and output time length is a great strength.Weaknesses: From the backend I’d say the lack of clarity and labelling of the pins on the actual sensor is a weak point for circuit builders and on the frontend the limited scope of the sensing angle is a weakness as well compared to other sensors which may sense a full 360 degrees.Applications: The datasheet provides some example uses of this PIR sensor for smart home technologies like air conditioning, doorbells and refrigirators,security tools like cameras and alarms, and lighting systems. It also lists “toy” as an application which intrigued me as an interesting base for ideating on how it can be used.Ideas:In the realm of “toy” applications I can see this sensor being used to create playful interactions and installations like a little toy boat that floats in a small bowl, controlling a motor to start moving in the water when it sensings presence in front of it or with many of these PIR sensors some installation with immersive audio that triggers playback of different audio files in different areas of a space depending on where motion is detected.Data SheetProduct Listing",

            "content_text": "The Intangible Interaction of Popular Voice Assistants (Siri &amp; Alexa)Research and writing done in collaboration with Bruce Arthur whose blog you can find linked here.Siri works through a combination of AI and language processing. Spoken phrases are converted into data files, and sent to apple servers where they can be decoded in language processing and responded to in kind. Settings can be adjusted to always be listening so that the interaction can be triggered remotely through the phrase “hey Siri”. Similarly, Alexa makes use of Automatic Speech Recognition which converts speech audio into text files that are then processed using NLP (natural language processing) to understand a user request before responding with a process or simulated speech (Source: nymag).Siri works through a combination of AI and language processing. Spoken phrases are converted into data files, and sent to apple servers where they can be decoded in language processing and responded to in kind.

Similarly, Alexa makes use of Automatic Speech Recognition which converts speech audio into text files that are then processed using NLP (natural language processing) to understand a user request before responding with a process or simulated speech (Source: Amazon). Siri is an intangible interaction that uses voice commands to activate certain functions of and iPhone and other apple products. The interaction can be initiated by uttering the phrase “hey Siri” to a device that has the proper settings enabled. From here, a user can control apps within the phone or the phone itself. For example saying, “hey siri, skip to the next song” will prompt the listening device to skip a track in many apple supported streaming services like apple music, SoundCloud, and Spotify. The interaction will also alert you that it has received a command through lights and sound, even sometimes going as far as to speak back to you depending on the request or its response. Similarly, Alexa makes use of voice recognition technologies to allow users control of software, and in some cases hardware, applications after an initial utterance like “Alexa” is made. This initial utterance is not subject to full-throttle speech recognition itself but rather a local program which compares audio waves, prompting speech recognition once the set phrase is spoken and recognized (Souce: nymag). Bruce Opinion: Personally I have no problem with the system of siri, but I do find the idea of an always-on listener a little problematic. Especially in a generation of targeted advertising and general internet security concerns, I think its giving tech companies like apple a little too many privileges to take the passive conversation and use that to improve their AI systems. The interactions, while useful, I don’t believe are worth my privacy. Sim Opinion: I’ve watched the use of systems like Alexa and Siri provide tremendous support to folks in my family with limited mobility and many responsibilities and I think that the system of voice control has great potential to bring a little bit of aid to many folks in similar situations. However, as discussed by Bruce, the question of privacy and security of speech documents is quite concerning, especially when this technology is developed by large corporations with known prior violations of privacy and data. In the households in my family that include children who make use of Alexa, I am glad that they are able to make use of the tools for self-learning and to connect with family and friends yet I worry greatly about their future in terms of their data and their right to have control of that. Additionally, the unreliability of the voice recognition technology with users of various dialects makes me question why the eagerness to constantly push and expand these products into the market. Detailed in Ruha Benjamin’s Race After Technology, a former Apple employee working on improving voice assistant technology for various dialects of English questioned the exclusion of African American english, to which a supervisor responded “Well, Apple products are for the premium market.” (Chapter 4: Why Now?, Page 32). In addition to this documented willful shortcoming of Apple to develop for Black Americans who speak AAVE, I’ve witnessed secondhand the extreme faultiness of Alexa when used by my grandmother who speaks English as a second language from a Spanish speaking background. Releasing widespread access to a technology that has the power to control so many different processes like sending messages or making purchases, knowing that it will be faulty for large percentages of the u.s. (and thus market) population is quite irresponsible in my opinion with the potential to do more harm than help for some communities.",

I went with this long piece from the scrap bin, it might even be the same piece used in class for the demo.Next, after turning on the dust collecter thing, I went ahead and sanded all sides of the piece on one end.Then I measures the piece out and marked where I could cut it to make a perfect square.After that I cut it with the circular saw before taking it to the drill press where this occured.I stop the drill press immediatley and just moved on because I though it had gone in enough. After cutting a bit of bit of wood off of the side off to make a lid using the belt saw I realized that the drill bit had not gone in deep enough to extent beyond where I cut the lid. So I decided to start all over again.I repeated everything above again (except the measuring and cutting to square moment). When I got to the drill press I was able to get a bit more progress, I think because I had adjusted the height and moved a little quicker but because their was no clamp the piece of wood stuck to the drill bit and spun around, I again stopped the drill press and just moved on to the belt saw where I cut the lid just right to have a hold from the press present on both pieces.I returned to the press to make use of one of those big bits from the drawer. Immediatley it was clear that without a clamp I was gonna get nowhere so I consulted the shop staff on duty who suggessted using the big bit in a hand drill with the table clamp. While this process took a bit more force and time it seemed to have a similar effect (although the hole is a little oval-like). I then tried inserting a screw with the hand dril but as always it got crooked so I undid it with a screwdriver and was able to put it in more straight using that tool. Lastly, I went a little silly and started to color over accent lines with a purple sharpie but the ink spread within the wood grains which I am not very happy with.                        I had to leave town last minute to deal with a family situation but if I have time when I return I want to try decorating it with other materials and try to make another box using this piece of wood I cut from a bigger cylinder piece in the scrap bin.",

Why did you consume it “live” or in real time? How was your relationship to the media or others affected through the “live” consumption of it? What was missing in your experience?The last live media I consumed was an immersive installation and performance event called “dream pit” at a gallery called Icebox Project Space. For the event series, the space was outfitted with a custom built stage that features a stereo sound systems and two subwoofers on one side of the very large room. On the other side of that room, facing the stage was a table with gear to control various lights, lazers and the rotation of a giant disco ball that was hung from between the two zones. The last performance I witnessed of the night featured an ambient drone sound artist called Phil Yeah who performed for an hour using various hardware synthesizers and samplers which filled the space with rich textures and vibration. At the same time a media artist called Tim Belkamp controlled the color and position of the intricate lighting and lazer system as well as the disco ball which reflected and manipulated the spread of the lights.I consumed this live media live because there was simply no other way, it was not being recorded (outside of through still images and a collection of social media clips) and the performance itself was shared specifically within the visual spatial installation which I probably could not replicate in my tiny bedroom. I also chose to attend this live media event because I wanted to experience the sound through the nice system while being surrounded by the lights as well as other people.Consuming the media live allowed users to take some control of their consumption of it by being able to walk around the space to catch different tones and beams. It also allowed the audience to enjoy the experience together and chat about different things they noticed or liked about the media in real-time below the loud volume of the audio element.I think the only thing missing from the experience is the ability to share it or pass it on to folks who were not there. Additionally the lack of permanenece of the live media event removes the ability to return or ground one’s presence or experience into the space.Assignment: use html, javascript, css with media elements to make a self-portrait in any sense of the term. think about multiple media, interaction, time based interaction in the context of a webpage.",
