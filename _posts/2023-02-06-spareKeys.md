<h2>Copying 5 Wooden Keys</h2>

This week for the assignment to make five duplicates of something I decided to make some pixel/blocky style wooden keys.

  
  I did this by first making a simple design in Illustrator before sending that to the laser cutter and creating a template jog on some plywood.
  
  Then I cut a piece of spare wood into 5 parts about 4 by 4 inches with the Mitor saw each before using the template jig to draw the outline of the key design on to the wood. 
  
  Next I took everything to the drill saw where I carved out the design. 
  
  Lastly making use of the drill press with one of those big (fisner?) bits I cut a hole into the head of the keys.

Upon leaving the wood shop I used something called a flies of rasp? with some sandpaper wrapped around it to smooth out the divits in the key. 

and for a hint of color and to really drive the whole key thing I tied the set together with some red yarn.
