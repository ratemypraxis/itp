<h1>Cube with something to say!</h1>

Making use of a audio sensing with a microphone breakout, this cube reacts to how loud it is in its immediate area with both colored light and sound. As 
it becomes louder, the cube mimics levels on an audio mixer by turning orange and then red. It also repeats playback of an audio file of someone saying
they have something to say, getting slightly louder and more upset sounding with each playback. If the area gets quieter with time the cube turns green before
thanking everyone for making space for it to speak and sharing a fun story about life as an audio reactive cube. The interaction begins once sound is detected 
prompting the LEDs to turn on and the audio playback sequence to begin.
