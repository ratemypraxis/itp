<h2> Field Notes </h2>

Early Morning Test:
- Pre-user testing enjoyment of bright lights emitted by project.
- Brief initial excitement at the action of pushing.
- Quickly bored and frustrated by limiation of color. 
- Previous understanding of screen/pixel loading
- More interested in filling in grid squares on paper surrounding toy with color pencils (less limiting space). 

Afternoon Test: 
- Understood how to begin interaction/play with toy.
- Interested in playing with project freely (changing all squares to one color).
- Showed understanding of pixel positioning through combination of play and discussion. 


Other tests:
- A few adults expressed interest in playing with a similar toy at a much smaller scale in a sort of fidget toy style. 

<h2> Evaluation </h2>

The combination of observations from the two user tests leads me to believe that while the physical apparance of the toy itself is attention grabbing, we 
could serve to improve it's context in an educational space. Testers seemed to enjoy interacting with the toy for some time in a playful or meditative 
way but the point we hoped to communicate of indicating that each pixel has a specific place on a screen needs to be re-worked into the design of the toy and its contexts.
