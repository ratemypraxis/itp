What is the Live Web? 

Homework: Write a blog post detailing the last “live” media you consumed. Answer these questions: What was it? Why did you consume it “live” or in real time? How was your relationship to the media or others affected through the “live” consumption of it? What was missing in your experience?

The last live media I consumed was an immersive installation and performance event called "dream pit" at a gallery called Icebox Project Space. For the event series, the space was outfitted with a custom built stage that features a stereo sound systems and two subwoofers on one side of the very large room. On the other side of that room, facing the stage was a table with gear to control various lights, lazers and the rotation of a giant disco ball that was hung from between the two zones. The last performance I witnessed of the night featured an ambient drone sound artist called Phil Yeah who performed for an hour using various hardware synthesizers and samplers which filled the space with rich textures and vibration. At the same time a media artist called Tim Belkamp controlled the color and position of the intricate lighting and lazer system as well as the disco ball which reflected and manipulated the spread of the lights. 

I consumed this live media live because there was simply no other way, it was not being recorded (outside of through still images and a collection of social media clips) and the performance itself was shared specifically within the visual spatial installation which I probably could not replicate in my tiny bedroom. I also chose to attend this live media event because I wanted to experience the sound through the nice system while being surrounded by the lights as well as other people. 

Consuming the media live allowed users to take some control of their consumption of it by being able to walk around the space to catch different tones and beams. It also allowed the audience to enjoy the experience together and chat about different things they noticed or liked about the media in real-time below the loud volume of the audio element. 

I think the only thing missing from the experience is the ability to share it or pass it on to folks who were not there. Additionally the lack of permanenece of the live media event removes the ability to return or ground one's presence or experience into the space.
