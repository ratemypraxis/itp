<h3>Making use of Runway's AI Magic Tools to generate a short video art film. </h3>

<h4>Workflow</h4>

1. I started generating an image with text to image an a prompt that read "electromagnetic field"
2. Then I sent that image to the image variations tool which I ran a few times before landing on an image that spoke to me.
3. From there ran Erase and Replace on one of the variations several times to create a few frames of the image transforming into a spriral
4. I then ran image variation again before dragging about 15 frames into Frame Interpolation to create a short video.


<h4>Describe the results of working with the tool, do they match your expectations?</h4>


<h4>Can you "break" the tool? In other words, use it in a way that it was intended for and what kinds of results do you get?</h4>
<h4>Can you find any pro tips in terms of prompt engineering?</h4>
<h4>Can you change your prompt to make the generated results better?</h4>
<h4>You can also pick one image from lexica as a start point.</h4>

<h4>Compare and contrast working with Runway as a tool for machine learning as related to ml5.js, python, and any other tools explored this semester.</h4>
