<h2> What Time Is It There? </h2>
A speech-controlled clock and installation which makes use of the <a href="https://worldtimeapi.org/">World Time API</a> to allow users to recieve what time it is in any part of the world. In the installation concext the piece is situated in a room outfitted with smart RGB lightbulbs and a speaker system which outputs abstract simulations of the feel of the given time.
