<h3>Training Earth</h3>

This week, in repsonse to the assignment of building on top of an ml5.js example, I made a minigame which allows the user to train a text-only virtual pet style character in non-visual concepts through visual input. Fell free to try the game here at <a href = "https://www.2nd.systems/itp/projects/teachingEarth">this link!</a>
