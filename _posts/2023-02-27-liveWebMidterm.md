<h1> Collaborative Live Audiobook <h2>
  A chat space in which users can record short bits of audio to a shared playlist with the goal of creating a cohesive story. The frontent webpage will
  display a text chat section for story planning, reactions, and whatever the users like. Another half side of the webpage will feature an audiozone
  with tools to record, playback and upload microphone recordings to a shared playlist. The shared playlist displays the same content for all users,
  attributing each added track to the inputted username of whoever recorded it.
