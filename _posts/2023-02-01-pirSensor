Find out the sensing angle, mix/max distance, and strengths/weakness. 
Tangibility, applications (with examples), weaknesses.
We’ll “map” these sensors together on a graph in the next class so have these information handy!
Research existing applications of the sensor and/or come up with ideas inspired by the sensor(either its use or how it works).
