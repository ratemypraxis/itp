Due Week 2 (Blog post by 7pm on Monday, January 31)

1 Observation

Spend some time in the bathrooms at 370 Jay to observe intangible interactions (automatic toilet flush system, faucet, towel dispenser…). I encourage you to analyze the interaction using Implicit Interaction Framework. If you want to read more about the framework, see Chapter 2 of The Design of Implicit Interactions (pw: intangible).

Or, if you find a non-intangible interaction that you want to replace with intangible interaction, you can observe and research them instead.

2 Research

How the sensing system works.

    1) Take a closer look at the system for some time and play with it by trying different actions. What did you find out? What is the most common error of the system?
    2) Search relevant information online. Consider these questions: Which sensors are being use in the current systems using? How are they programmed? How are they embedded on the device? How do they decide when to activate (flushing, dispensing, making sound…)? 

3 Ideation

If you have more time after observation and research, identify what the most common errors are in the system, and answer either of these questions. Feel free to make a simple sketch of your ideas. * Note that this is about ideation only and you’re not expected to make anything for this. The examples by previous students below show prototypes since the instruction was different at that time.

    Option 1. If you were to redesign it, how would you improve the system?
        As an example, does the system give enough feedback for the intangible interaction? Would adding feedback indicator that shows the status of the system or interaction feedback be helpful? (e.g., LED indicator, alarm sound, voice…).
        Michelle and Schuyler’s toilet doors can be another example.
    Option 2. Can you think of creative ways of taking advantage of the erroneous system? It can be a whimsical interaction that is totally useless.
        In case you’re curious, some examples from past years’ students are (with a focus on toilet): Lu Lyu’s Kissing Frog, Name and Themis’ Gamble Flusher, Rae and Yiting’s Pooping Toilet
